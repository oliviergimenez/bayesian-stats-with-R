You can install them all at once by running the following code in the R command line:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"R2jags\", \"here\", \"lme4\", \"visreg\", \"lattice\", \"brms\"))\n\n\nCredits\nMany slides are from a workshop we used to run a loooong time ago with Ruth King, Byron Morgan and Steve Brooks. I also re-used or adapted slides by Richard McElreath, Kerrie Mengersen, Francisco Rodriguez Sanchez, Jim Albert and Jingchen Hu, Tristan Marh, Jason Matthiopoulos, a paper by Michael McCarthy and Pip Masters, Andrés Lopez-Sepulcre and John Kruschke’ book cover. The sources for the images are James Kulich, Matt Buck, xkcd and Mike West.\nCorrections\nIf you spot a typo or an error, find a bug, want to suggest changes, or have trouble running the code, please file an issue or get back to me\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
